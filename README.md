# Networq

## What is "Networq"?

In technical terms: Networq is a *multi-dimensional graph* building platform.

Think of it as a cocktail of Mindmaps, Business Methodologies, ERP.

You can use these graphs to organize your business, team, project, infrastructure, life and much more...

## What can I use Networq for?

Quite a lot actually! We've collected a set of use-cases to inspire you [here](use-cases/).

## How does it work?

Using Networq you build *Graphs*. *Graphs* contain *Nodes*. *Nodes* get tagged with one or more *Types*.

*Types* give *Nodes* their *Properties*.

*Types* and *Nodes* can be bundled up into a *Package* to share it with others.

You can import *Packages* from others to re-use their work in your own *Graphs*.
