# Getting started

## Prerequisites for Installing NetworQ

The following prerequisites must be met before undertaking the installation:

1) You are familiar with using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

2) You are familiar with editing [YAML](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)

3) You are able to run ([minimum version 7](http://php.net/downloads.php)) [PHP](https://php.net) applications on your machine.


4) You are able to run [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
NB further system-dependent instructions for installing composer are available [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

If one or more of these conditions are not met, then don't worry. Rather, check out the [demo](demo.html) installation instead!
