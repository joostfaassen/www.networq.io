# Use-case: Enterprise / Business Architecture

Use Networq to define  a Graph of your business containing all your team-members, suppliers, projects, products, processes.

Once you've defined your entire business as a Networq Graph, you'll have a single "Source of Truth" that serves as input for many different business scenarios:

* Automatically generated Employee Manuals guaranteed to be current
* Generated organizational charts
* Compliancy control and auditing reports
* Permission rules (authorization matrixes) for external services
* HR applicant tracking
* Performance evaluations
* Business Process definitions with generated documentation
