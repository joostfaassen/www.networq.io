# Use-case: Holacracy

Tag your organizations and organizational units as Holacracy Circles and tag your team members as Holacracy Partners and start governing your business with Roles, Governance Meetings, Tactical meetings, Strategies, Domains and more. 

As you'll be able to re-use your existing employee/freelancer/supplier data you'll be working from a single source and don't need to add them to Holacracy specific environments and tools.

Viewing a partner page will list all of his/her holacracy details (circles, roles, etc) right next to other relevant types like HR information, Competencies, payment details, contact details and everything else related to this one person.
