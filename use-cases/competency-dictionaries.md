# Use-case: Competency dictionaries

Define your own dictionaries listing competencies and their associated levels. Package them up in reusable lists and easily attach them to job postings, projects or even individual actions.

Tag your team members with a competency profile to keep track of their current levels, target levels and notes of their evaluations.

Competency dictionaries can be packaged up for re-use between companies. Company A can publish a beautiful "Communication specialist" competency dictionary, while Company B publishes a "Customer service" competency dictionary. Any company can now import (define a dependency on) these competency dictionary packages and start using them in their business.

Shareable competency dictionaries have a number of benefits:

* No need to re-invent the wheel. Just use existing dictionaries where available, and only define your organization-specific competencies yourself.
* Use the best dictionaries designed by domain expers from other organizations.
* Mix and match to cherry pick specific competency definitions.
* Dictionaries can be automatically updated so you'll get maintenance updates and enhancements for free.
* Collaborate with other domain experts on competency dictionaries on GitHub/GitLab/etc.

Build supportive dictionaries by attaching learning resources for each competency level to support
team-members in leveling up.
